# Week 3 Lab Notebook

---
This week I have been adding alot more games. It has been a little hard and i have gotten into a couple problems with teh layout of them, and sometimes they would not show up properly, though these issues were easily fixed with the help of my partener, and our peers. I have added a word game, a factorial calculator, an inspirational saying generator, a clicker game, darts and a stopwatch. There are some issues with darts though me and my partner are currently trying to fix it
