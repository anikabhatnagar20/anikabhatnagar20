    "Blog Python Model code and SQLite Database.\n",
    "From VSCode using SQLite3 Editor, show your unique collection/table in database, display rows and columns in the table of the SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the database it has a list of all the houses and it’s needed in order to display all the houses on the site. Each house has an id, and a bunch of different tags like state, zip code, long/latitude coordinates, and price. \n",
    "From VSCode model, show your unique code that was created to initialize table and create test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An SQLite database is like a digital version of that notebook. It helps you organize your movie information neatly. In this digital notebook, you can create different sections for movies, like one for action movies, one for comedies, and so on. Initialization of table data means filling in your notebook with some movie names, actors, and maybe release years to start with. This way, when you open your notebook, you already have some movies listed, and you can add more as you watch them. It's like setting up the basics so your notebook is ready to use right away.\n",

    "Lists and Dictionaries\n",
    "Blog Python API code and use of List and Dictionaries.\n",
    "In VSCode using Debugger, show a list as extracted from database as Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In VSCode use Debugger and list, show two distinct example examples of dictionaries, show Keys/Values using debugger.\n",
    "This error had to do with the real estate map. The debugger helps to identify the issue, and see what the problem is affecting. By putting breakpoints, you can see where exactly the code stops working, and fix the problem\n",
    "APIs and JSON\n",
    "Blog Python API code and use of Postman to request and respond with JSON.\n",
    "In VSCode, show Python API code definition for request and response using GET, POST, UPDATE methods. Discuss algorithmic condition used to direct request to appropriate Python method based on request method.\n",

    "In VSCode, show algorithmic conditions used to validate data on a POST condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Postman, show URL request and Body requirements for GET, POST, and UPDATE methods.\n",
    "This postman step is essential in order to ensure that the api is authenticated. To do this, the uid and password need to be put into the body, and this will allow it to go through. In this screenshot, the id and password for the pre-authenticated user, Toby, is but into the body. \n",
    "In Postman, show the JSON response data for 200 success conditions on GET, POST, and UPDATE methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you press send on the post method, you get a successful authentication for toby. When deleting authenticate and changing the method to get, the body will display the authorized token. Using the update method is for making a change in the user’s information, so as an example you could change the password for toby’s user in body, and once you press send, it will make this change in the database. \n",
    "In Postman, show the JSON response for error for 400 when missing body on a POST request.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Postman, show the JSON response for error for 404 when providing an unknown user ID to a UPDATE request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a 404 error that is shown in postman. \n",

    "Blog JavaScript API fetch code and formatting code to display JSON.\n",
    "In Chrome inspect, show response of JSON objects from fetch of GET, POST, and UPDATE methods.\n",
    "In the Chrome browser, show a demo (GET) of obtaining an Array of JSON objects that are formatted into the browsers screen.\n",
    "In JavaScript code, describe fetch and method that obtained the Array of JSON objects.\n",
    "In JavaScript code, show code that performs iteration and formatting of data into HTML.\n",
    "In the Chrome browser, show a demo (POST or UPDATE) gathering and sending input and receiving a response that show update. Repeat this demo showing both success and failure.\n",
    "In JavaScript code, show and describe code that handles success. Describe how code shows success to the user in the Chrome Browser screen.\n",
    "In JavaScript code, show and describe code that handles failure. Describe how the code shows failure to the user in the Chrome Browser screen.\n",
    "Optional/Extra, Algorithm Analysis\n",
    "In the ML projects, there is a great deal of algorithm analysis. Think about preparing data and predictions.\n",
    "Show algorithms and preparation of data for analysis. This includes cleaning, encoding, and one-hot encoding.\n",
    "Show algorithms and preparation for predictions.\n",
    "Discuss concepts and understanding of Linear Regression algorithms.\n",
    "Discuss concepts and understanding of Decision Tree analysis algorithms.\n",
