# Week 0 Lab Notebook

---
This is the very first week of school and CSP. I am getting familar with the terms and websites we are using. I am downloading my terminal and VS code and homebrew. All of this stuff is needed for my blog. We have picked a partner to work in CSP with, my partner is Ananya.
