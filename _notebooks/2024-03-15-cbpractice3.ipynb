    "I chose option D but the correct one was A. The variable second was 200, though it points to temp, which is 100, meaning that the actual value would be 100, rather than 200. This is why option A is correct. \n",

    "Option A would be correct becasue the code segment starts count at 1 and increments it after the outer loop. The robot travels 1 square forward, rotates left, then 2 squares forward, 3 squares forward, 4 squares forward, then turns left. Robots exit the grid looking up in the lower right corner. It initializes count to 0 and increments it to start the outer loop. Since count is initialized to 0 and incremented immediately, the inner loop iterates the same number of times as the outer loop in the supplied code. Robots exit the grid looking up in the lower right corner.\n",

    "The rigth answer would be j = 5, k = -5, inside the loop, the number of k is decreased by 1 over and over until k = 0. If k is negative at the start, it will keep going down until it reaches 0.\n"
