    "I chose option D but the correct one was A. The variable second was 200, though it points to temp, which is 100, meaning that the actual value would be 100, rather than 200. This is why option A is correct. \n",

    "Option B would not code segment continues in an infinite loop but the robot would not be able to move forward. But option C would eventually get the robot in the correct box. \n",

    "B is wrong because with this change, if the method finds a number that is bigger than or the same as the one before it, it will say true right away and won't look at any more numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "B is correct since for Devices B and C to stop communicating, they must be totally disconnected from one another. Device B and Device C can still communicate even if any three connections are removed.\n",

    "![Image](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher_portfolio/assets/142547044/137684a9-c046-469b-975b-2e2b3c0679cd)\n",
    "\n",
    "Option A would be correct becasue the code segment starts count at 1 and increments it after the outer loop. The robot travels 1 square forward, rotates left, then 2 squares forward, 3 squares forward, 4 squares forward, then turns left. Robots exit the grid looking up in the lower right corner. It initializes count to 0 and increments it to start the outer loop. Since count is initialized to 0 and incremented immediately, the inner loop iterates the same number of times as the outer loop in the supplied code. Robots exit the grid looking up in the lower right corner.\n",

    "Option A would be correct since each step is dependent on the step that happens before it, then each step has towait for the first step step to complete before starting the next one.\n",

    "\n",
    "The rigth answer would be j = 5, k = -5, inside the loop, the number of k is decreased by 1 over and over until k = 0. If k is negative at the start, it will keep going down until it reaches 0.\n",

    "Public-key encryption keeps the internet secure which is why A would be correct. It makes sure unauthirzed users are not able to go into something they do not have acess to. \n",

    "OPtion C is correct because the first call to botStepper moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it left so that it faces toward the top of the grid, moves it forward two squares, and rotates it right so that it faces right. The code segment then moves the robot forward one square. The second call to botStepper moves the robot forward three squares, rotates it left so that it faces toward the top of the grid, moves it forward three squares, and rotates it right so that it faces right. The robot ends in the gray square. Option A is wrong because the first call to botStepper moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it left so that it faces toward the top of the grid, moves it forward two squares, and rotates it right so that it faces right. The second call to botStepper moves the robot forward three squares, rotates it left so that it faces toward the top of the grid, moves it forward three squares, and rotates it right so that it faces right. The robot ends one square to the left of the gray square.\n",

    "In option C, tricking a user into providing personal information is an example of a phishing attack, but it doesn't directly gather personal information. But option A is correct since the rogue access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks. Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified.\n",
